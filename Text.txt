The 2022 Indian Premier League, also known as IPL 15 or for sponsorship reasons, Tata IPL 2022,[2] was the fifteenth season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a professional Twenty20 cricket league established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. The tournament was played from 26 March 2022 to 29 May 2022. The group stage of the tournament was played entirely in the state of Maharashtra, with Mumbai and Pune hosting the matches. The full schedule of the tournament was announced on 6 March 2022.

The season saw the expansion of the league, with the addition of two new franchises.[5][6] Therefore, this was the second season to have ten teams, after the 2011 tournament.[7] Chennai Super Kings were the defending champions, having won their fourth title during the previous season.

In the final, Gujarat Titans beat Rajasthan Royals by seven wickets to win their first IPL title.
Although earlier reports suggested the addition of two more teams in the previous season,[10][11][12] the BCCI at their 89th AGM announced that the expansion of the league would occur only in 2022.[13][14] In August 2021, the BCCI confirmed that two new franchises would join the league starting from the 2022 season. It was also announced that the franchises would be based in two of the six cities shortlisted by the BCCI; Ahmedabad, Cuttack, Dharamshala, Guwahati, Indore and Lucknow.[15][16]

In a closed bidding held on 25 October 2021, RPSG Group and CVC Capital won bids for the two teams.[17][18] RPSG paid ₹7,090 crore (US$930 million) for Lucknow, whereas CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,625 crore (US$740 million).[19][20] The Lucknow team was named as Lucknow Super Giants on 24 January 2022,[21] whereas the Ahmedabad team was named as Gujarat Titans on 9 February 2022.

Vivo pulled out as the title sponsor of the tournament on 11 January 2022. Vivo, having previously pulled out as sponsors in 2020, had signed contract as title sponsors till 2023. The Tata Group was named as the title sponsor for the remainder of Vivo's contract.
